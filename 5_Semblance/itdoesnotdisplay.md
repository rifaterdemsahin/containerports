HTTP ERROR 502

To resolve the HTTP ERROR 502, you can use Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests and forward them to your Python application. Here is an example of how to set up Nginx with your Docker container:

1. Create an `nginx.conf` file with the following content:

    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://app:8080;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
    ```

2. Update your `Dockerfile` to include Nginx:

    ```dockerfile
    # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
    FROM python:3.8-slim

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . /app

    # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

    # Install Nginx
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx

    # Copy Nginx configuration file
    COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

    # Make ports 80, 443, 8080, and 9090 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 80
    EXPOSE 443
    EXPOSE 8080
    EXPOSE 9090

    # Define environment variable
    ENV NAME World

    # Start Nginx and your Python app
    CMD service nginx start && python app.py
    ```

3. Rebuild and run your Docker container.

This setup will allow Nginx to handle incoming requests on port 80 and forward them to your Python application running on port 8080.
